For a years I was working as a Real Estate specialist but I was always interested in modern technology. I had an opportunity to test applications on the business side and I felt it is work I'd like to do every single day. When I read about QA role and responsibilities on IT side I decided to invest in myself and change my career path. I think I have all soft skills qualifications that good QA should have. I strongly believe that with my experience, client focus approach, perfectionism and passion to technology I can become an expert in that profession brining value to release better products.
